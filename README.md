# README

A simple program for downloading BMP images over Wifi on an ESP8266 and displaying them to a Waveshare 7.5" b/w/r E-Ink display. This is a modification of the [wifi example included in GxEPD2](https://github.com/ZinggJM/GxEPD2/blob/master/examples/GxEPD2_WiFi_Example/GxEPD2_WiFi_Example.ino).

**Screen:**

880Ã—528, 7.5inch E-Ink display HAT for Raspberry Pi, red / black / white three-color

SKU: 17960

Part Number: 7.5inch HD e-Paper HAT (B)

Brand: Waveshare

**Controller:**

ESP8266

# Creating BMP images

Note that any BMP images displayed using the bitmap processing included in the GxEPD2 examples must have a color table size that is equal to the square of the bit depth of the image. I used Photoshop to create BMP images that had a bit depth of 4 and a color table size of 16. Given that my E-Ink display only supports 3 colors, I set the first 3 colors as black, red, and white, and then padded the rest of the colors with black until I had 16 colors in total.
